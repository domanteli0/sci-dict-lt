# Science dictionary LT -> EN

When googling about math, transition to English easily!

Check out the deployed website here: [sci-dict.org](http://sci-dict.org)

If not deployed, this is the v1.1.0 pdf version of website [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/naglissul/sci-dict-lt/files/13461074/Science.Dictionary.LT.-_.EN.pdf)

The branch "dereleased" keeps the version v1.1.1 which for now will not be used and will be deleted, but in later versions will be used again.

## How to use?

Use Ctrl+F of "Find in page" to find your word or category.

## How to contribute?

See mistakes? Know a word that's not here? Know a better translation?

- Email me [naglis.suliokas@gmail.com](mailto:naglis.suliokas@gmail.com) or
- Fork repo and create a PR after modifying [./server/src/dictInit.sql](./server/src/dictInit.sql) file.

## For developers

### Tech

- React JS
- React-bootstrap
- GitHub Pages
- yarn

### Run dev

Basic run for react app with npm.

## Future ideas

Admin and user acc. User can provide a translation for the admin to review. Do that with API keys.

Add mini likes - translations with least like will be eliminated (archived)
